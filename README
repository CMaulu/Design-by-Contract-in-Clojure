Dissertation submission for an M.Sc. in Software Engineering from
Oxford University.

The dissertation looks at the implementation of a design by contract
framework for Clojure.  There's a lot of emphasis on providing
contract support for high order functions.

The dissertation is produced as a literate program in emacs' org-mode.
Tangling the org files produces the clojure source files whilst org's
LaTeX export is used to produce the submitted pdf file.
